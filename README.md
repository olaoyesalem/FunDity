## Problem
Currently,The lack of transparency in traditional fundraising methods can make it difficult for donors and backers to track the flow of funds and ensure they are being used appropriately. This can create challenges in establishing trust between fundraisers and donors.Also, traditional fundraising methods may not be accessible to everyone due to their stringent requirements, which can exclude individuals and organizations that could benefit from fundraising.Lastly,traditional fundraising methods may come with high fees and transaction costs, which can eat into the funds raised and make it more difficult to meet fundraising goals.

## Benefits
Transparency: Fundity provides a transparent and open platform for crowdfunding, ensuring that every transaction and contribution made to the project can be tracked and viewed publicly.

Decentralization: Fundity  is built on a decentralized network, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority. This makes it more secure, resilient, and resistant to censorship.

Lower costs: Traditional crowdfunding platforms charge fees for every transaction, which can be a significant burden for the project owners.Fundity  can eliminate these fees or charge a lower fee, making crowdfunding more accessible and affordable for everyone.

Increased trust: The use of blockchain technology in Fundity  can help build trust among the participants. Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that records every transaction in a transparent and secure manner, making it difficult to manipulate or alter the records.

Global reach: Fundity can be accessed from anywhere in the world, making it possible for anyone to contribute to the project, regardless of their location.

Smart contracts:Fundity  can utilize smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that automatically enforce the terms and conditions of the agreement. This can help to eliminate the need for intermediaries and streamline the crowdfunding process.
